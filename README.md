This Project is a simple put together solution for a Hilghy Avalible PiHole solution
We will use Keepalived to act as a load-balancer and failover solution for the PiHole web interface
We will use Orbital Sync - https://github.com/mattwebbio/orbital-sync to keep the PiHole web interface up and running
Use the Docker Compose file to spin up the Docker containers for Orbital Sync
Use the conf file as a template for Keepalived.
